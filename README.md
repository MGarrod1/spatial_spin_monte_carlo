## Requirements

The code was validated using Python 3.7.4 on an Anaconda distribution (conda version : 4.8.3). A full list of the packages installed can be found in the *environment.yml* file. This can be used to construct an identical anaconda environment to that used to perform the simulations. See the Anaconda [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more details.

## Installation

To install run: *python setup.py install*

If this does not work then try running: *python setup.py develop*
